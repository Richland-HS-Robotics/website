        <h2>CENTERSTAGE - 15010</h2>

        <p> This is the robot that we built for the 2023-2024 CENTERSTAGE
            challenge. It is our most successful robot yet.</p>

        <br />

        <p> We never really achieved a good design for the pixel intake and
          outtake, so this season we really focused on the endgame tasks, as
          well as the autonomous section. Together, our excellent endgame and
          autonomous got us to 5th place in the qualification rounds of our
          interleague tournament. For the playoff, we convinced team #11990 RUN
          KANO to pick us entirely because of our autonomous and endgame.
          Together, our alliance won our semifinal, and then went on to win the
          final in an exciting final match.</p>

        <br/>

        <p> Unfortunately, only three teams were set to advance from our region,
            so we were unable to advance to state. </p>

        <h2>POWERPLAY - 18249</h2>

        <p>This is the robot that our junior team #18429 built for the 2022-2023
        POWERPLAY challenge. Although they did not have nearly as many resources
        as the main team, they ended up outperforming them. </p>

        <br />

        <p> With this robot, we were able to achieve 9th place in the
            qualification matches, before being picked by team #11990 RUN KANO
            for the playoffs. Together our alliance won our semifinal, winning
            one of our matches by only 6 points! However, we were beaten in the
            finals by teams #8099 and #19589. </p>

            Unfortunately we suffered some electrical and connection issues, so
            we did not do very well with this robot.  We did decently for our
            first two league meets, but had issues for our interleague
            tournament and ended up down in 14th place.
