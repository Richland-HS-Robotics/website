Lead Programmer

<!-- Would be shown when you expand the specific profile. -->
<!-- This text is AI generated :) -->
My name is Calvin Tallent, and I am a programmer on the Richland High School
robotics team, FTC #15010. I have a deep passion for technology and engineering,
which drives my involvement in robotics. As a programmer, I work on developing
innovative solutions and software that help our team tackle various challenges
in competitions. This experience has not only honed my technical skills but has
also taught me the importance of teamwork and problem-solving, which I believe
are essential for success in any field.

Outside of robotics, I enjoy playing soccer and have a strong appreciation for
music. Soccer keeps me active and allows me to collaborate with my teammates on
the field, while music provides a creative outlet that balances my technical
pursuits. By engaging in these diverse interests, I strive to cultivate a
well-rounded personality and contribute positively to my school community. I am
excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead in both my
academic and personal endeavors.
